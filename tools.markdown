This page lists a few of the Open Source tools I'm working on.

### [PEV2 - With Local Storage Support](https://pev2.pages.dev)
[PEV2](https://pev2.pages.dev) is a tool to visualize Postgres EXPLAIN Plans and store them in the browser's local storage.

This is a fork of [PEV2](https://github.com/dalibo/pev2). They initially supported storing plans in local storage, But recently (~ August 2022) they moved to storing the saved plans in their Database without any support for local storage.
So I have forked this to support saving plans in local storage.
